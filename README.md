## Project Overview
This project studies how model compression techniques, such as pruning, affect fairness in large language models.

## Proposed Approach

The approach can be divided into three main stages:

1. **Model Selection and Compression**
2. **Bias Evaluation Design**
3. **Comparative Analysis of Efficiency–Fairness Tradeoffs**

### Model Selection and Compression
We will start with pretrained transformer-based models, such as BERT or smaller LLaMA variants to ensure feasibility under compute constraints. Each model will undergo common compression strategies:

- **Pruning:** Gradual magnitude pruning of weights at different sparsity levels.  
- **Quantization:** Post-training quantization (8-bit and 4-bit) for weight and activation reduction.  
- **Knowledge Distillation (Stretch Goal):** Training a smaller student model from a teacher model to study transferred bias patterns.

### Bias Evaluation
We use the **StereoSet** dataset to evaluate social bias (stereotype vs. anti-stereotype completions).  
Models are scored using masked language modeling, where the most likely completion determines bias tendency.  
Metrics include:
- **Stereotype Rate:** fraction of bias-related completions favoring stereotypes.  
- **Proportion Breakdown:** counts of stereotype, anti-stereotype, and unrelated predictions.  
- **Average Inference Time:** per example latency to evaluate efficiency tradeoffs.

### Comparative Analysis
TBD
